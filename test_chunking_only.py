Abstract

Financial market simulation is crucial for validating trading strategies and understanding market dynamics. However, existing methods often struggle to generate realistic and controllable market scenarios. We propose DiGA (Diffusion Guided Meta Agent), a novel approach that combines diffusion models with meta-learning to generate controllable financial market data. Our method enables fine-grained control over market conditions while maintaining realistic statistical properties. The mathematical formulation min Ex‚àºD(pG(x) ‚à• q(x)) captures the essence of our optimization objective."""

2.1 Market Simulation

Traditional market simulation approaches have relied on agent-based models and statistical methods. The challenge lies in capturing the complex dynamics of real markets while maintaining computational efficiency. Recent advances in deep learning have opened new possibilities for market generation.

2.2 Diffusion Models

Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in various generative tasks. The forward process q(xt|xt-1) = N(xt; ‚àö(1-Œ≤t)xt-1, Œ≤tI) and reverse process pŒ∏(xt-1|xt) form the core of the diffusion framework. Our work extends this to financial time series generation."""

3.1 Problem Formulation

Let X = {x1, x2, ..., xT} represent a financial time series where each xt ‚àà ‚Ñùd corresponds to market features at time t. Our goal is to learn a generative model G that can produce realistic market scenarios while allowing control over specific market conditions.

The optimization objective can be written as:
min_Œ∏ Ex‚àºpdata[L(x, GŒ∏(z, c))]

where z is random noise, c represents control parameters, and L is the loss function measuring the quality of generated samples."""
